Doggo v1.0
==========

The purpose of this project is to build an image classifier that
accurately identifies pictures as containing a dog or not. Initially
this was our goal, but as our classifier got more accurate in predicting
pictures containing dogs, we decided to have it classify other animals
as well. We are now able to run datasets of different animals through
our model to train and test, then see if it can accurately predict a
picture’s subject. Once this process is finished, we are able to save
the model and pick back up where we left off next time we decide to work
with it. Our average accuracy is currently at around 87% but requires
more training as we input more diverse animals (other than just dog and
cat).

Getting Started
---------------

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on
your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment
for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

> Python 3.6
> [*https://www.python.org/downloads/*](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
>
> Anaconda 5+ *https://www.anaconda.com/download*
>
> conda update -n base conda

Keras
[*https://keras.io/\#installation*](https://keras.io/#installation)

> conda install -c conda-forge keras

### Installing

The below steps will allow you to download this code and run it locally.

1.  Clone git repository
    > [*https://github.com/SirMrMistery/Doggo.git*](https://github.com/SirMrMistery/Doggo.git)

2.  Open Anaconda application

3.  Open Spyder

4.  Click File -&gt; Open and open P2.py

Running tests
-------------

1.  ### Click the play button at the top of Spyder to run P2.py

2.  In the console space, type the number of the picture you would like
    > the image classifier to run against

3.  After seeing the prediction, enter in the console “0” to run more
    > tests or anything else to stop execution

4.  Repeat Steps 2 and 3 with different numbers of pictures to test the
    > classifier against different pictures
